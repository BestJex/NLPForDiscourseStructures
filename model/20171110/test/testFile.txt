In most cases, borrowing money from others is an injury to our relationship.
However, is it still right under the condition that the man who ask you for money is your friend?
This question triggers an interesting debate.
As far as I am concerned, borrowing money from freinds will not damage our friendship.
My reasons and examples are given below.
Borrowing money from friends is not harmful to true fellowship.
Every time my fiends ask me to lend some money to them, I meet their requirement.
That is because we are good friends and greatly know about each other, which means there is no need for us to worry about the situation that we can not get our money back.
I have a real friend whose name is Cheng.
Sometime I just forget to bring our purse outside.
When this happened,  I will ask him for money and pay the money back in a week.
In fact, we even do not care about if the money can be returned because we are such good friends.
In some cases, borrowing money to friends even can strengthen the companionship.
Offering help to your friends is an effective mechanism showing that you love them.
Imagine that there is one of your friend give you a hand while your are facing the problem that you cannot solve it along ,you will fall in love with him.
No one hate the feeling of realizing that your friend care about you.
My father has borrow some money to one of his friend Wang two years ago, who was going to buy a new room that time.
After getting help from my father, Wang consider my father as the best friend of him hitherto.
Admittedly, because of the greed of our mind, some of your friend may not return the money back.
In reality, a friend who betrays you for money is not a real friend of you.
Comparing with the friend above, real friends understand that which is more important between friendship and money.
As for you, there is no need to sustain a friendship with those who do not cherish you.
From what has been discussed above, borrowing money from friends cannot damage the friendship.
It is not only because true friends believe in each other, but also because lending money to others can show you care about them.

I don't agree that borrowing money from friends will inevitably harm the friendship because it's a normal thing in some degree especially when we have some troubles,and the friendship would not be affected if the repudiation or default doesn't happen.
True friends won't be separated by a reason of money unless when they lose trust on each other,
which is because of that the friendship is on the basis of the trust.
I borrowed money from my friends few times,our friendship didn't be affected at all,because they give help when I truly need,and I returned my great credit and honesty by paying back money on time.
That is because of the trust , I asked help from my friends and they borrowed me money ,this didn't make a loss of friendship.
On the contrary ,it  may contribute to a better trust and closer relationship,for the reason of money thing,it help us see each other in a realistic prospect,the person who borrows the money and the person who is been borrowed may increase their friendship basing on the generosity and reputed return.
Somebody thinks that borrowing money will harm the friendship  between friends,this may because they take the money as a very sensitive thing,so the relationship referring to money is fragile.
As a matter of fact,true friendship would never been damaged since that the foundation of it--trust won't been rocked  by the issue of borrowing money.
Therefore,a good repute borrowing would never be harmful to the friendship.
Hence,I don't favor the point that borrowing money will  cause a damage on friendship.
In my view,the most important thing is the friendship between friends will not be affected by borrowing money as well as trust between them,if not ,they might be closer on account of this matter.
Friendship is an indispensable part of our life, a profound friendship is the fruit of long term of hard-working.
Borrowing money from friends may result in conflicts about returning money.
Friendship is something pure.
However, once involving conflicts of interests such as money will do harm to the friendship
we may be embarrassed by borrowing money from friends.
Equality is the basis of friendship.
If conflicts of interests are mixed among friends,
Admittedly, the contact between returning money and borrowing money can enhance friendship.
As a matter of fact,
For the sake of maintaining and developing the friendship among friends, we'd better not
Within the context of modern society , the issue of money arouses nationwide argument.
It may leave others a bad impression when the issue of some affairs comes to money .
As a resultThroughout my life, I have been lucky enough to have a very good relationship with my parents.
They have supported me, given me necessary criticism, and taught me a great deal about how to live my life.
Parents can be very important teachers in our lives; however, they are not always the best teachers.
The true friendship will not be damaged by issues concerning money.
During the process of communication, gaps may rise in the circumstances where the two can not trust the othe one.
Parents may be too close to their children emotionally.
Sometimes they can only see their children though the eyes of a protector.
For example, they may limit a child's freedom in the name of safety.
A teacher might see a trip to a big city as a valuable new experience.
However, it might seem too dangerous to a parent.
Parents are usually eager to pass on their value to their children.
But should children always believe what their parents do?
Maybe different generations need different ways of thinking.
When children are young, they believe that their parents are always rights.
But when they get older, they realize there are other views.
Sometimes parents, especially older ones, can't keep up with rapid social or technology changes.
A student who has friends of all different races and backgrounds at school may find that her parents don't really understand or value the digital revolution.
Sometimes kids have to find their own ways to what they believe in.
The most important thing to realize is that we all have many teachers in our lives.
Our parents teach us, our teachers teach us, and our peers teach us.
Books and newspapers and television also teach us.
All of them are valuable.
Nevertheless, I think that the most important lessons can’t be taught; they have to be experienced.
No one can teach us how to get along with others or how to have self-respect.
As we grow from children into teenagers, no one can teach us how to deal with peer pressure.
As we leave adolescence behind and enter adult life, no one can teach us how to fall in love and get married
The most important thing to realize is that we all have many teachers in our lives.
Our parents teach us, our teachers teach us, and our peers teach us.
Books and newspapers and television also teach us.
All of them are valuable.
There are always some occasions we need money without having enough cashes at hand.
In this case, we can choose to borrow money from our friends, relatives, banks, or even unauthentic organizations.
Some people claim that borrowing money from friends will be harmful to the friendship.
However, from my point of view, I do not believe that this claim can hold water.
There are some reasons and examples given below to illustrate my viewpoint.
To begin with, the problem of money will never give rise to antagonism in true friendship.
Friendship is built with mutual trust just as a house is built with bricks.
As long as we, as friends, trust each other, we will not worry about the possibility that the friends we lend money to refuse to pay back on purpose.
Moreover, if a friend failed to repay on time, we would tend to believe that he/she ran into some sort of trouble and we should share the hardship with him/her.
My friend, Tom, is a case in point.
He is so forgetful that he always go out without a wallet.
As a result, he constantly borrow money from me.
But we still get along very well because I trust him and he does always pay back on time.
In addition, it is possible that our companionship develops by borrowing money from each other rather than being damaged.
It sounds unconvincing but lending money to friends can be a chance to get closer with them indeed.
For instance, Jim, one of my classmate at college, had quite a period of hard time back then.
Due to his family's financial troubles, he was unable to even buy the textbooks, so he found me, who was not that close a friend at that point, to give him a hand.
Since then, we got closer and became intimate, having fun and hanging out together regularly.
Admittedly, I am not denying that borrowing money from friends or lending money to friends lead to no problem at all.
It is possible that a friend can borrow money from us without paying back and, under this condition, fellowship might be shaken.
However, this case is quite unlikely as long as we make friends with the right persons and build the true friendship.
To put it in a nutshell, borrowing money from friends is perfectly fine without being an injury to friendship.
It is not only because true friends will never be suspicious of each other, but also because borrowing money can sometimes be a chance to develop the friendship.
Sometimes, we may be low on cash.
In this case, turning to our friends may bring lots of convenience.
But is it a good idea to borrow money from friends?
Does it harm the friendship?
Some people claim that the friendship will be harmed as long as it has something to do with money.
From my point of view, borrowing money from friends is not an injury to the companionship.
I'm going to elaborate my point in the following paragraphs.
Firstly, friends can easily understand that our borrowing is fair and reasonable.
We may be in need of cash occasionally.
Under this condition, It would be troublesome for us to fetch some cash.
However, it would be quite convenient if we turn to our friends.
Thus, quite a bit time and energy would be saved.
I remember there was a time that I went to the cafeteria of our school having left my wallet in my dormitory.
Instead of fetching it in my dormitory, which was some distance away, I chose to borrow from my friend and roommate, Zhang.
Then when we got back to the dormitory for a rest after having a meal, I just paid him back.
You see, it's fairly convenient.
Furthermore, borrowing from friends probably make friendship firmer.
Need for money is also a kind of need for help.
We will be grateful if a friend lends his/her money, simply because they are giving us a hand.
Therefore, in future, we will be more willing to help them, in a financial or a non-financial way.
Consequently, our friendship is sure to be more intimate than ever in the process of helping each other.
Once in a while, I lent 100 to one of my friend, Chan, who is short of cash when signing up for a match.
About 2 weeks later, I asked him about a math problem which I'm confused about.
Since I had lent my helping hand, he was more than willing to help me get to the bottom of it.
After that we often helped each other and our friendship lasted long.
Admittedly, to borrow money means you have to pay it up.
There are a great deal of misunderstandings created by forgetting to return it.
However the misunderstanding will be perfectly settled as long as we do as below.
Whenever we are borrowing, we should not forget to set a reminder of "return $?? to ??" on our to-do list.
If we've lent our money out to a friend and he/she haven't paid us back, chances are good that he/she forgets about it.
In this case, we can simply reminder of him/her politely and our money should be returned soon.
From what we discussed above, borrowing money isn't harmful to fellowship.
It's not only because our friend can easily understand we are borrowing for reasons, but also because borrowing will make the fellowship even better.
Nowadays, with the advent of the society, the relationship between person become more sophisticated.
As a result, a discussion between whether borrowing money from friends might do harm to the friendship was heatedly debated.
Some people embraced the opinion that it might don't do bad effect on the relationship since friends should help each other.
However, with the following suggestions, I keep the statement that it might deteriorate the friendship.
Firstly, if one borrows money from his people, it will cause controversy between friends.
Since if the friendship was influenced by the economic  disputation, the friendship between two persons will become impure.
Since it is hard for each to determine several problems about the borrowing money, for example when to return the money back or whether there is interest when one return the money.
Consequently, it might cause plenty of contradictions between friends.
As the contradictions exaggerating, the friendship  will be breached
Secondly, borrowing money  from friends will lose our face.
Since equality  is  the foundation of the friendship.
If one borrow money from his  friend, he will feel lose his face when he meet with his friend.
As a result, he will feel a shame of meeting with his friends, so he will avoid the meeting as far as he can.
After a long time, the tight relationship between two people will soften, then the friendship will me deteriorated.
Some critics might oppose the opinion since friends should always give a hand to each other.
However, in my opinion, it will cause several problems if the money-connection was created between friends.
Thus  borrowing money from friends will deteriorate  the friendship.
All in all, I keep my statement that borrowing money from friends will do harm to the friendship.
I don't think that borrowing money from friends is harmful to friendship.
The true friendship won't be hurt by borrowing money between real friends.
The true friendship won't be hurt by money.
In the process of human communication,if both sides don't believe each other, it will be easy to get trouble.
Friendship is built on believing each other.
I never urge my friend after she borrowed money from me.
And she must give money back to me in time.
Borrowing money from friends doesn't injure friendship,even it can deepen the friendship.
Only when people get in trouble,they will make a decision to borrow money from others.
So lending money to your friends,they will appreciate you.
Mary,my best friend,had some difficulties with her family.
She had to ask me for money and I gave it to her immediately.
She was thankful to me.
After this matter,our friendship was going to be better.
Some people think borrowing money from friends may be harmful to friendship because it will relate to money disputes.
Actually,true friendship won't be hurt.
Friendship is on the basis of equality and trust.
As a result, borrowing money from friends won't injure friendship.
In conclusion,borrowing money from friends won't damage friendship.
We always have some time that we need much money, such as buying a house or a getting illness, making us having to borrow money if our prosperity is not enough.
At that time, the first person that comes into our mind is usually our friends.
Maybe someone might believe that borrowing money from friends would harm friendship, but I  think that borrowing money from friends will not hurt friendship.
The truly friendship will not be hurt because of money.
Unless we do not trust each other, then our relationship would not be hurt easily during our communications.
A truly friendship is based on trust.
In most times, your friends come to you for help only when they have no idea what they should go looking for.
Therefore, if we have enough ability to help them, then we ought to lend some money to them to help them make through hard times.
Because we are friends, I choose to believe in you.
And truly friends will try his/her best to protect the precious trust, rather than leave you far far away because of some money.
Indeed, borrowing money from friends will not hurt friendship, but improve your relationships.
Your friends must meet some problems so that they need your help, so you and his/her friendship could be improved if you give him/her a hand at that time.
I still remember the first time my family bought a new house, and my parents needed to borrowed some money from their friends, none of them refused.
Since then, my family always say that we could not live such a comfortable room without their generosity.
Cases like my family's are many, your friend would feel grateful if you help them in time.
Some people may consider that borrowing money from you friends would hurt friendships, because their relationship would break up if their friends refuse to give the money back.
Actually, the truly friendship will not be hurt because of that, because a real friend always take care of his/her friends' feeling.
All in all, borrowing money from your friends is not only a test about whether your friendship is countable, but also a method to deepen your relationship.
Therefore, borrowing money from your friends will not hurt friendship.
There is a old quotation in China which says,"A hedge between keeps friendship green".
Somebody thought that friendship must not have relationship  with money.
Money, which accompanied by materialism, will be harmful to friendship and make it no more pure, but a interest.
That is to say, friendship should maintain its purify and simplicity as it deserved.
However, in my opinion, friendship represent trust and helping each other.
Borrowing money from friends doesn't mean it will damage friendship.
True friendship will not be broken down because of borrowing money.
From big field,  there will be a rift in interpersonal communication if both sides are distrust each other.
From details, friendship is based on trust.
If my friends ask me to lend them some money, i will consider my finacial capability at first, and when i confirm that they are not swindle, i will be glad to heip them.
On the other hand, they will also give me a hand when i am in trouble.
However, borrowing money from friend will spoil friendship is nonsense.
On the contrary, this kind of deed will deepen friendship as well as keep friendship ever green.
So, how to understand lending money to friend is a accelerator to  the depth of friendship?
It occurs to me that one night after the self-study, the time was very late, my firend suddenly found that she had not enough money to take a bus to go home.
She was worried to tears.
When she saw me, she asked me to borrow her some money.
I gave her some of my allowence and took her to the bus station, where we can both took a bus to go home.
After that, we became good friends, when one was in trouble, we would do our utmost to help each others.
From this case, it  take roots in my heart that lending money to friends in right ways  can vitalize the friendship.
There are also some people may claim that borrowing money will trample the friendship, for some friends always forget to repay, or lending money will creat crevice and suspicion.
Actually, a pure friendship will not break because of this, for it will be reliable and worthy.
Under the circumstance which finance is available, there will not have a rift of displeasure.
So, we can say that borrowing money will not destroy the friendship which has a  deep root.
In short, i believe borrowing money will not spoil friendship.
Only we can be thoughtful, be mutual understanding, and our money is under our budget, as well as we can trust each other, we can deepen our existing friendship and creat new friendship.
once my close friend didn't want to talk to me till now because of borrowing money, and deleted my from wechat software.
borrowing money from friends will produce contradiction because of returning money.
Friendship is pure and the money involved will make friendship unpure and breed controdictions to hurt the friendship.
One of my close colleagues ask two or three hundreds from me every times untill
borrowing money  from friends may make us lose face.
Friendship is based on equality,and if it is mixed with money, one will feel disgraced in front of the other, so the equality balance is broken to damage the friendship.
Once under the condition, I borrowing money from my best friend who said that she had no money to lend directly.
At that time I felt dishonored and the friendship was not as good as it looked.
Therefore, I always reminded of borrowing money as soon as I thought about her, so the contact reduced slowly because of the shade of psychology and the friendship became lighter and lighter.
Somebody may think that borrowing money may not influence the friendship because making money is for helpping each other.
But in fact, once the money is involved, the problem occurs such as returning or not returning the money or when to return the money.
These problems will injure the friendship.
So I think borrowing money will hurt our friendship.
All as above, borrowing money from friends not only produces controdctions about returning the money,  but also make us lose face.
In the end, I think borrowing money will damage the friendship.
As the saying goes, "A good friend on the way is the shortest cut."
Scarcely can one doubt the significance of friendship, while controversies exist when money interferes - some argue that borrowing money from friends can harm friendship.
However, I beg to differ.
First and foremost, genuine friendship won't be affected by money issues.
As far as I'm concerned, friendship is built on the basis of mutual trust.
From this perspective, conflicts occur only when mistrust takes place in the relationship with others.
Taking myself for instance, I'm more than glad to offer reasonable financial aids to my friends if they need any.
Due to the confidence of my friends' honesty, worries concerning their failure to pay me back have never bothered me.
To put it in another way,
To most people, money is icon of profits.
Generally speaking, We should make our best to protect our friends from loss of profits.
However, borrowing money from friends may harm their profits.
So I think that borrowing money from friends is harmful to friendship.
Here are some reasons to name.
First, when you ask friends for money, it may leads to the argument on returing the money.
The friendship is pure, and once the it was dirted by the profits such as money, it will germinate lots of contradicts, which will hurts friendship itself.
When I was in my high school, I always stayed with Anna.
Each time when we go out to have a fun, I always had to pay for Anna because she never brought her purse.
Again and again, and Anna seldom remember to return money.
Later, think Anna is a girl who is just greedy, and not own credit.
It's really not a good choice to be good friend with her.
So I just get away from her gradually.
Second, borrowing money from friends will let us feel shame.
The fellowship was built on equality.
If one borrows money from the other, he or she will feel inferior to the other, which break the balance of fellowship and damage it.
When asking others for money, It makes me feel ashamed.
It seems that I  can not afford what he can afford and I always can not bring enough money.
And my friends confusion also embrasessed me,which made me want to avoid going out with him.
Less communication just decay our friendship.
Although, someone may argue that borrowing money won't do any harm to friendship, for the friendship is valuable.
But, in fact, when money is mixed into the relationship of friends, it becomes problems.
For example, if you forget to return money, or if you feel sad.
Those problem will have bad influence on friendship, so I think borrowing money is harmful to friendship.
All in all, I insist that borrowing money makes no good to friendship.
Although, a bit help and return in time won't do much, but borrowing will become a habit.
If you are getting used to borrowing again and again, it would eventually hurt your friends and yourself.
So it would be better not to mix the friendship with profits such as money.
A lot of people hold an opinion that borrowing money from friends may be an injury to the friendship.
In my opinion,however,borrowing money from friends will not damage the friendship.
Real friends do not generate enmity for money.
In the process of interpersonal communication ,if we do not trust each other,it will be easy to generate enmity.
Friendship is built on the basis of trust.
I will return the money I borrowed from my friends as soon as possible.
Because of my great attention to the friendship,I will return the money early so as to protect the trust between me and my friends.
Borrowing money from friends will not do damage to the friendship,but inprove it.
It is sure that somebody is in trouble if he have to borrow money.
Your friendship will be definitly inproved if you lend him the money he needs.
When I was traveling in Japan with one of my friends,he lost his credit card.
Then I borrowed him some money to help him be able to enjoyed the traveling ,instead of having a terrible trip because of lacking money.
After that he became my best friend.
It is supposed to help each other between friends,including helping each other by money.
A friend in need is a friend indeed.The relationship between friends is built stronger because of these helping.
Somebody thinks that borrowing money will damage the friendship because one may suspect that you are just contacting with him because of money.
In fact，a real friendship will not be damaged by this.
A real friendship is not based of money,but the trust that generated after a long time companion,never suspecting.
So,it will not damage the friendship borrowing money from friends.
To sum up,a real friendship will not generate enmity.
Lending money to friends and helping him from troubles will also improve the friendship.
So borrowing money will not damage the friendship.
There are always some difficulties in life and lacking money is one of them.
To solve the problem,we can borrow money from a bank,or a relative,or a friend.
The feasible way is borrowing money from a friend.
In my opinion,I don't think borrowing money from a friend can damage the friendship.
Real friendship will not be influenced by the money.
In daily interactions with friends,if they do not trust each other,it is easily to create trust  issue.
Fellowship is on the basis of mutual trust.
Before a friend borrows money from me,as long as we make a pact on the date he pays me back,I usually lead it to him.
It does not affect our companionship at all.
The pact is the sign of mutual trust.
Meanwhile,trust is the foundation of friendship.
When friends respect and follow our pact,it perfectly shows our good friendship.
Borrowing money from a friend not only is not an injury to friendship but also reinforces it.
Whatever happens for a reason,especially borrowing money.
It is good for people to help out a friend if he is in a hard time,which would move their friendship onto a next level.
Once a friend of mine wanted to buy a limited-edition T-shirt which was 500 yuan.
He was ready to break his piggy bank and then found out he still needed 100 yuan more.
So he asked me for the money and made a pact with me promising he would pay my back within a month.
I lent it to him before he bought the fancy clothes.
After that,he paid me back as he promised and we became close friend since then.
He would told me secrets that I did not know before.
When a friend needs money,it is also a time to test the friendship.
And it is always to tell who is the true friend or who is not from borrowing money.
What's more,when someone cherishes something,he puts his heart in it and pays more attention to it.
Some say borrowing money is harmful to friendship because they think it is money that sabotages their friendship.
In fact,those who change their attitude once borrow money from you,deep down inside,do not think of you as a friend,more of a nobody.
The fellowship does not even exist all the time.
As a matter of fact,true friendship does not change because of it,because true friends make a pact with you before you ask and respect the pact by paying back on time,at the same time,is appreciated by each other involved.
The first thing to know is that real friendship will not be influenced if borrowing money from a friend.
The second thing is that a true friend will try his utmost to let you perceive his sincereness of appreciating the companionship.
So borrowing money from a friend is not  an injury to friendship.
The first solution is borrowing money from friends when people in poor economic situation and extremely need money.
Some people claim that borrowing money from friends is an injury to friendship.
From my perspective, real companionship is so strong that it won't such fragile.
There are some reasons and examples to illustrate my opinion.
First, the problems about money can't effect real friendship.
In the process of interpersonal connection, if they don't trust each other, the gaps are easily formed between them.
Accordingly, fellowship is built on trust.
Moreover，Both of borrowing money from friends and lending money to friends are the performance of trust.
For instance, once I had to borrow money from one of my friends because I spent all my living expenses too early.
My friend didn't hesitate to lend money to me, although she knew I couldn't pay back the money in a short time.
Two months ago, I had given money to her.
During this period, our relationship wasn't influent by money.
In addition, friendship isn't damaged but enhanced by borrowing money from friends.
There must be some reasons for friends to borrow money.
Under the condition, helping the friends in trouble can improve your companionship.
For example, uncle Li, one of my father's friends, has ever borrowed money from my father due to the sickness of his family.
At that time, my father didn't hesitate to give uncle Li a hand.
Till now uncle Li still appreciate my father when it has been mentioned.
Misfortune tests the sincerity of friends.
The relationship between uncle Li and my father wasn't impacted but is more solid.
They got out of much predicament owing to mutual support.
Admittedly, some people believe that borrowing money from friends is harmful to fellowship in order that not paying money back for a long time tend to cause to estrangement.
In fact, compared with emotion between them, money as the material tool is not important.
Therefore, the real friendship is sturdy enough to avoid harm.
In a nutshell, it is not detrimental for people to borrow money from friends.
It is not only because the real fellowship doesn't be fragile by money, but also doing tough friends a favor can deepen friendship.
Furthermore, the companionship not only represents the emotional connection of two persons, but also contains the companionship of communal experience and growth.
There is a old Chinese saying“ a friend in need is a friend indeed”.
The precious friendship is as firm as rocks.
i,m totally agree with this statement that borrowing money from a friend would damage the friendship of us.
we might have some conflicts for borrowing money from our friends,
the friendship is pure,but once it is related to money ,the friendship would be greatly hurt for many conflicts would born and it would not be pure any more
borrowing money from our friends may make us feel uncomfortable,because the friendship is based on equality.
once the friendship is related to money affairs,the balance would be broken and one of them might feel shame then the friendship would get hurt greatly.
i won,t borrow money from my friends in any case,except without any other choice,it will make me feel uncomfortable and always owes my friends.
the friendship between may get hurt, because we could feel uncomfortable when we meet each other.
someone might have the thought of brrowing money from friends won,t affect the friendship,they even think it,s a good way to strengthen their friendship.
howerver,the friendship would be changed once it is related to money affairs.
along with many problems ,you may feel uncomfortable when you refuse to borrow you friend money or ask them to pay back you money as soon as possible.
all of these things would hurt the friendship.
after all,my opinion is that we shouldn,t  borrow money from our friends except without any other choice,
it will make both sides feel uncomfortable ,which gonna hurt the friendship of each other
Money is a sensitive topic.
People tend to keep away from talking about money.
But it is an inevitable topic.
For instance, it is possible that returning the money may cause contradiction.
The friendship is pure.
But when it comes to a interest problem like money, the friendship becomes impure.
It will cause a lot of contradictions, which is harmful for friendship.
For example, after a dinner party, Xiaoming was ought to pay for the part of xiaohong's, but he forgot it.
Xiaoli was responsible for collect money.
He realized it, but he didn't say anything.
He thought Xiaoming pretended to be muddled.
What about the other reasons?
Borrowing money from friends may make us embarrassed.
Friend ship is based on equality.
If friendship is evolved with  interest, the equality will be broken.
The man borrow  money feels shame when he meets the other one, and the friendship will fade away.
Some people are rich, but some people don't .
So there will not be balance in their mind.
There will be status difference between them.
Because of the contradiction, the friendship becomes bad.
Some people say that borrowing money from friends will not affect friendship, for lending money can show one's kind.
But in fact, once friendship is involved with money, many problems will come out.
For example, don't payback, too long to payback ,etc.
All these problems can do harm to friend ship.
So I think borrowing money can affect friendship.
In summary,  the unbalance caused by borrowing money can ruin friendship.
There is a variety of stuff in our normal life, especially you may be badly in need of money.
In this case, It is unavoidably that we borrow money from our friends.
With this phenomenon comes an interesting discussion, some people advocate that borrowing money from our friends would hurt our friendship.
I do not believe that this claim can hold up.
There are some reasons and examples to illustrate my point of view.
A fissure would not appeared in real friendship because of the money.
If the mutual mistrust is still there, in the course of interpersonal communications, It would give birth to the fissure.
Friendship is based on the trust.
While friends borrow money from me and I can afford it, It is my pleasure to lend it to them.
In my opinion, friends who trust me are willing to borrowing money from me, and so do I.
Friends are always supportive of each other which is supposed to be.
Besides, I think that friendship is incomparable to money.
Borrowing money from friends not only will not harm the friendship, but deepen friendship.
Something must happened before you borrow money from your friends.
And under this circumstance, if you could be generous with money to help your friends, it must promote your friendship.
For instance, Mr. Wang, who my father grew up with, failed in his business and cash flow problems have occurred.
After that, my father watched Mr.Wang's back while he know the problem.
Till now, Mr.Wang still appreciate dad when they mentioned this story.
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
This example illustrates that borrowing must be for a reason, and timely assistance could enhance friendship.
Someone believe that borrowing money from friends would harm the friendship, because it will change friends' deposits to influence their life.
Virtually, the real friendship would not be spoiled.
The true friend would be happy to help you with all their heart when you need, which show the real friendship.
Thus, borrowing money from friends would not hurt the friendship.
In summary, the real friendship would not be broken by money, and borrowing money from friends will not harm the friendship, but deepen friendship.
So, I advocate that borrowing money from friends will not hurt the friendship.
Nowadays, people may often borrow money from friends when people find their wallet empty, this has become a phenomenon in modern days.
And I don' think borrowing money from friends will do harm to our friendship.
Firstly, it seems that true friendship will not be damaged when getting in touch with money.
People will only have doubts with each other when they do not trust each other.
However , trust is the basis of friendship.
For example, once I cooperated with a friend to do a sales project, it is easy to see that money is involved here, however, this did not do anything to our friendship and we are always good friends.
In a nut shell, true friendship will not be destroyed by money.
So borrowing money from friends can do no harm to our friendship.
Secondly, borrowing money from friends is not such thing that will harm friendship but what strengthens friendship.
Well, borrowing money will need a reason, and if your friend can truly understand that and lend a helping hand to your emergency, it should deepens the friendship.
Once I lost my wallet and got into trouble, I asked my friend Elsa for help and she helped me sincerely.
From that on, our relationship doesn't seem to have got any harm, but became tighter because of that issue.
In one word, this action of helping each other deepened our friendship.
Some people think that borrowing money from friends is something destructive to friendship because they think that profit will take the place of friendship.
However, frankly, the profit between each other is also an important part of the social contact between people.
Therefore this kind of social contact can only make friendship greater.
So, borrowing money from friends will not harm friendship.
In conclusion, borrowing money from friends will do no harm to friendship,
not only because true friendship will not be destroyed by money, but also this kind of behavior which means helping each other can only strengthen friendship.
Nowadays, some people think borrowing money from friends can harm or damage the friendship so that they tend to avoid this sensitive issue.
They'd rather keep their mouths shut and suffer alone than ask their friends for help even when they are in urgent need.
However, I think borrowing money from friends can be harmless to the friendship and may even enhance the friendship.
The true friendship will not be damaged because of money.
If there is interest relationship between friends, but he need the money more than me, I will be still willing to lend money to them.
Because of the friendship to my friends, it is surely much better to help him rather than just look on when he is really in urgent need and I won't lost much.
It is the significance of the friendship that we stand out for our friends in need.
Borrowing money from friends not only wouldn't harm or damage the friendship, but also can deepen the friendship.
Last winter vocation, a friend of mine traveled in Japan and asked me to help her turn on the international roaming service in Beijing.
However, the preliminary requirement to turn on this service was that the balance of the mobile phone must reach the minimum requirement at least, and she couldn't recharge in Japan.
Without any hesitation, I recharged hundreds yuan directly for her.
Though this money was not a huge sum, it was also big to we students, and this really made her grateful.
I believe that friends are supposed to help each other.
Only when we accompany with our friends and help them when they need can the friendship be deeper and deeper.
Some people think borrowing money can harm the friendship because money is related to personal interests directly so that borrowing money would damage others' interests more or less.
However, as a matter of fact, the true friendship will not be damaged because of this in that borrowing money is not permanent as long as we pay back in time.
Therefore, borrowing money from friends will not be an injury to the friendship.
To sum up, the true friendship will not be injured by money.
Borrowing money from friends not only won't be an injury to the friendship, but also deepen the friendship.
So I think borrowing money from a friend can not harm or damage the friendship.
Because of the wide social activities and increasing price, borrowing money from friends tends to be more and more common.
Some people may think that borrowing money from friends may damage friendship,
however, I believe that real friends will not care about that.
True friendship will not be obstacled by money.
In the social relationship, if people do not trust each other, it would be easy to make some problems.
Friendship is on the foundamental of trusting in each other.
I believe that when my friend comes to me for money, they must have gone through some difficulties in their economy.
I will help them as far as  I can and will not hope that they can return the money back.
If their economic situation become better, they will give me the money back.
If they don't, they must still face some difficulties.
So I won't ask them to give the money back.
Borrowing money from friends may sometimes not only has no damage to the friendship, but also contribute to it.
If we can help people to come over their hard situation, the relationship between us will increase to a higher level.
One colleague of my English teacher once borrowed some money from him when the colleague left the school to create his own career.
After three years, he succeed in his new project and returned the money back to my English teacher and even send some stock of his new company to my teacher.
The belief in the friend's ability and the support reflects their deep relationship with each other.
Some people may think that borrowing money from friends may be harmful to the friendship because if the firend refuse, both sides will feel very embarrased and uncomfortable.
In fact, real friendship will not be damaged because they will explain the reason for their inconvinience and try to help the lenders in other ways.
So borrowing money from firends will not become an injury to the friendship.
To summarise, real friendship won't be stoped by money.
Helping friends to over come difficulties will also make the relationship much closer.
So I think borrowing money from firends will not hurt the friendship.
Nowadays, plenty of people like to borrow money from their friends.
Someone may think that borrowing money from friends indicates our trust on our friends, which is not bad.
However, from my point of perspective, borrowing money from our friends may be harmful to our friendship.
My reasons and examples are as followed.
Firstly, borrowing money from friends might ignite some conflicts when it comes to repaying money.
Friendship is pure.
But when it is concerned with interest such as money, it will be impure and conflicts will come up.
Finally, fellowship is harmed.
Once when I go to a restaurant with one of my friend Mike, he forgot his wallet, and I payed his bill.
He promised that he will repay the money as soon as possible.
But he broke his promise and repayed it after a month due to my urge.
Mike may not repay it late on purpose.
However, his behavior had influenced my ordinary expense, which resulted in my disgruntlement and finally reduce my trust on him.
Secondly, borrowing money from our friends may embarass us.
Friendship is based on equality.
However, when it is related to money, one might feel shame when meeting another.
Thus, equality is break and friendship is no longer robust.
When going out with friends, I hope that we can pay our own bill separately.
Even though I don't have enough money, I won't borrow lot's of money from my friends.
I think that if I borrow a great deal of money, it might shows that I am much poorer than him, which makes me feel shame.
And as a result, our companionship will be injured.
Someone probably think that borrowing money from our friends is innocuous to friendship since help between friends is conducive to friendship.
However, when friends have some relationship which is based on money, lots of problem will come out.
For example, friends might have disagreement on when to repay the money.
All kinds of problem will do harm to companionship.
In a word, I think that friends may disagree each other on when to repay money on the one hand,and that the person who borrows money will lose face on the other hand.
Taking these factors into account, I hold that borrowing money from friends is truly harmful to fellowship.
we all cherish our friends in this material-dominated world.
But it's common for everyone to encounter the valley when you lost your way,especially we need help from our friends.
Borrowing money from friends is a typical thing to test the friendship.
Actually, I don't think borrowing money from friends can hurt friendship
and this essay will develop in two parts to prove my views.
A real friendship will not be fragile results from money.
In daily communications, If people do not trust each other it will usually occur trouble.
Friendship is set up on a trust basis.
When a friend of mine borrows money from me, it only means that we have a relationship on debts which would not influence original relations.
Lending money to my friends will develop our friendship instead of destroy it.
There must be some reasons behind when you have to borrow money from others, and if you lend him the money generally in time, it will indeed consolidate your friendship.
Once my best friend wants to celebrate her boyfriend birthday, and she is running out of money at that time so I lent her 300 RMB to help.
It is my help that moved my best friend and her boyfriend and make her boyfriend realized her girlfriend must be kind too because she has that kind friend.
My friend appreciate my help a lot and when I was in trouble she is always the first one to give me her hand.
So it is easy to tell that lending money to your friends will not only maintain but also develop your friendship.
Some people argue that borrowing money from friends will do harm to friendship because they believe money is a sensitive region in relationship.
Once you mention money, your friendship decays and it will no longer be the previous pure one.
In fact, the real friendship will probably not be beaten so easily.
You and your friends become friends results from your similar hobbies and characteristics, not money.
So it's unnecessary to worry about money will be the factor to take apart your friendship.
To put into a nutshell, borrowing and lending money to your true friends will not influence friendship.
There can't be a gap between true friends, to the contract, it will develop the friendship when you help your friend who is in difficulty.
Everyone will face to lack of money sometimes, and friends are always on list of people who are suitable to borrow money.
Imaging a situation that you saw commodity and your friends are shopping together,
However, in my opinion, borrowing money from friends is a risky behavior, because it might damage friendship easily.
Borrowing money from friends will lead to conflict of repayment.
Friendship is pure, once it has relationship with interest dispute, friendship won't be  pure anymore and generates many contradictions which harm to friendship.
I used to lent money to one of my friend for emergency, and she promised that she will repay to me as soon as she has enough money.
But from then on, she always shirk to repay.
After several times communicate, I lost faith to her because of she's perfunctory attitude and decided to be quite of she's society.
Borrowing money form friends also makes us lose face.
Friendship is built on equality.
If friendship involves benefit relationship, one will be embarrassed by another, thus, an equal relationship will be destroyed and friendship will be damaged too.
After borrowing money from friends, I will become very afraid of that my friends mention lending money to me when we are meeting.
As we know, friendship plays an important role in one's life.
Helping each other is an unavoidable topic when geting along with friends, especially interacting on finance.
Some people think financial interaction do no harm on friendship, as long as building a great relationship.
Personally, I believe borrowing money from friends can actually damage our friendship.
Borrowing money from firends can cause conflict due to the duetime.
Friendship is pure, once refferring to some profits, it will become inpure.
Thus, contradiction may occured and friendship will be damaged.
When I graduated from the university, my friend Xiao he came to my home.
Because she did not have enough money to pay for the tickets, I paid her in advance.
After a year, Xiao he did not pay back at all.
Her silence made me feel that she did this on purpose, and our relationship soon went sour.
Thus, our friendship been damaged.
it couldn't be more common for people to suffer being in need of money abruptly.
Although money,being related to interests among us, is thought may hurt the relationship between friends,i still thing it isn't that much serious and can even make friendship be more close.
firstly, there shouln't emerge problem between friends only because of money.
on the avaliable ecomonic condition, i would lend my money to friends with no hesitate when they need it.
never will i be consious of whether they can repay my money since i totally trust my friends.
from my point of view, friends won't doubt each other for the interests of money, which contributes the well protection of friendship,if they have confidence in their partners.
not only won't lending money to friends do harm to relationship, which but also will be deepened.
there must be some reson that people may borrow money from their friends.
if we can do them a favor as soon as possible,our friends will appreciate it much and trust us better.
for example,one of my uncles borrowed some money from my father when was in economic poverty.
he is sill grateful for my father's quick help.
as the saying goes,friends in need is a friend in deed,that thing results father and uncle getting closer and closer to each other in these days,
which indicates that  the relationship can be proved to be strong by streching out your hands when friends in need.
Also someone may think that can be harmful to friendship.
if friends don't have the ability to repay it, their interests will suffer a lot,leading harm between both themselves and their friends.。
actually, with understanding, we won't care much about it when compared to the truely trust between us., which means that borrowing the money from our friends is ok.
in a word, though some problems may appear during our friends lending money from us,we should still believe offering help won't do harm to our friendship because of understanding and trust!
Most of people will meet variety of people during their whole life.
Some of them were just the passengers of life, the others of them will become the soul mate.
The true friendship won't be affected by money.
In interaction, if there's no trust between each other, the conflict easily happened.
The friendship is build on the trust with each other.
That's mean, these friends had been filtered to true friends by condition and time.
Thus, if I meet the economic dilemma suddenly, I will ask my friend to borrow money from them.
Since the long time relationship, they know me very well that I will pay back on time.
And they will enjoy the feeling of demanding and strengthen our friendship.
Borrowing money from friends won't damage the fellowship, instead, it will empowered to friendship.
It must has reasons to borrow money from someone.
If a friend could be generous and give a hand, it must be strengthen the relationship between friends.

Her friend borrow the money immediately despite 20,000 is not a small amount.
Helping people in time is very valuable, mom is closer with her friend from then on.
Someone think borrow money from friends is harmful for friendship due to no forever friends but interest.
In fact, the true friendship can't be damaged cause real friends are relatives so borrowing money from friends is not an injury for friendship.

Borrowing money is a sensitive topic all the time.
In plenty of novels and films, we can always see the same scenes that good friends break up because of borrowing money.
However, as far as i am concerned, borrowing money from friends cannot injure the fellowship in reality.
Gaps will never be produced between the true friendships because of money.
It is obviously that only when people don't trust each other in the communication, the gap will appear.
In other words, friendship's foundation is to trust our friends.
For example, when my friends is in urgent need of money, I will lend them money as long as I am eligible with pleasure.
Owing to the belief to my friends, I needn't worry that they will disappear after borrowing money from me.
And as for me, friendship will never be impaired because of the conflict of interests involved money.
Moreover, borrowing money not only will damage the friendships but will also deepen them.
The reason is that when people ask others for help, them must have their causes so that if we could offer a helping hand to them, our friendships will be much deeper.
Everyone will meet the shortage og money, which makes them borrow money from others to go through the crisis.
At this moment, friends always comes first.

because of the fact that friendship is much more signifcant than money.
When you are short of money, the first idea appears in your mind may be to borrow it from the person you familiar with.
Recently, a discussion on if borrowing money from friends is harmful to fellowship has aroused.
In my opinion, it will not damage the friendship for quite sure.
My viewpoint can be well illustrated by the following reasons and examples.
The true fellowship could not be hurt by the money problem.
In social communications, it will be a gap between friends if they disbelieve each other.
When a friend of mine comes to me because of the shortage of money, I would lend them some in general circumstances.
If he is my real friend, he could be hesitated for a while to ask for money to me, which prove that he will not be embarrassed to do that and show the belief for me.
And once he do not return the money back, I would think that he is not deliberately to do it, and he must have his own sack.
Borrowing money from friends not only has no damage to fellowship, but also can help building the companionship more rigid.
There must be some reasons when somebody asking for money.
Therefore, if one can offering a help in this particular time, it can improve the connection between the friends.
Somebody may think that borrowing money from friends may be injury to fellowship, for the reason that it is a sensitive topic of borrowing money, which will test the friendship and lead to the disintegration of friendship.
In fact, true fellowship will not be impact by this because it is on the basis of belief, which would not tremble due to the money issue.
So, borrowing money from friends will not damage the fellowship.
In conclusion, true fellowship will not split the connection between friends, and it will lead to a more rigid relation.
So I believe that borrowing money from friends will not damage the fellowship.
In  our life , it is a common situation of lack money, and borrowing money from friends is a common method to deal it.
However,somebody worries that borrowing money will be embarrassed for each other.
But In my view, borrowing money won't damage fellowship
The true fellowship won't create a gap because of money.
In the process of interpersonal communication, if they don't trust each other, the gap will be create easily.
fellowship is built on trusting each other.
When MaYun started-up, nobody believed him, but his friend decided to borrow him money,and work with him.
At last, Mayun builds his business empire,the fellowship between him and his friend become love, and his friend becomes his wife.
Borrowing from friends will make friends fell be needed, be trusted, and won't create gap.

When Marx write Marxism,he is in the worst situation.
But his friend Engels always sent his money, made sure of his life.
As a result, Marx finished his book and became a great people that no one can   ignore in the history of philosophy.
The fellowship between he and Engels is phrased widely.
When people drug in problems, send money and help friend will make friend cherish the fellowship with you,and will make the fellowship deeper.
Although,sending money to friend have to stand the risk of no returning,
but it is the willing of stand the risk show the value of the fellowship
In a nutshell, borrowing money from friend is basis on the trust, and it won't damage the fellowship ,but make it deeper.
In the past, borrowing money from each other between friends is a common enough occurrence in China, whereas nowadays, as the development of economy and the influx of new ideological trends, many people begin to hold the opinion that the most essential ties of friendship is built on the communication in the spiritual world.
As a result, borrowing money between friends implies that their spiritual connection has been tainted by money.
As far as I'm concerned, I don't think borrowing money from my friends will damage the friendship, instead, it can reinforce our friendship.
A genuine friendship will never ever been injured by money.
During the process of interpersonal communication, friendship are tended to be impaired if mutual trust hasn't been built.
The truth is that friendship can only be achieved on the basis of mutual trust.
For example, when Karl Marx writing the masterpiece Das Kapital, he was trapped in an economic plight and even had no money paid for food for his family.
It was his friend -- Friedrich Engels who provided him with a long term economic aid which lasted for decades and their friendship has never been harmed by money at all.
As I said before, the true friendship which must be founded on mutual belief and did exist between Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels  would never be hurt by money.
borrowing money from friends won't injure their friendship, instead, the bond between them can be enhanced,
it must be due to some reason that someone decide to put forward the request to borrow money.
If we are able to meet their demands with generosity, our friends will certainly appreciate it.
As a result, a stronger friendship will be created.
Take me, for instance, I have a classmate whose spending exceeded the predicted cost during his travel to Beijing, so he borrowed 1000 yuan from me and paid it back immediately after he came back to school.
Meanwhile, he bought a souvenir for me to express his appreciation.
As long as mutual trust existed between friends and the one who borrows money always repays it in time, there will be no injury to their friendship.
some people hold the view that borrowing money will hurt friendship as they think borrowing money from friends may made them seem like they make friends only for money.
As a matter of fact, the true friendship means helping each other, of course containing the help with money.
Thus, borrowing money will not damage friendship definitely.
In summary, it's a reasonable behavior to borrow money mutually between friends if their friendship is built on the trust, lending money to friends so that they can tide over difficulties and even achieve his career goal will absolutely cement friendship rather than impair it.
We often encounter difficulty in our life time and need help from friends.
Affected by the market economy, providing money with no doubt becomes an efficient way of help.
However, whether friends should borrow money from each other has always been a heated topic in society.
People are concerning about the relationship between morality and interest rather than discussing an economic bahaviour only.
In my opinion, borrowing money from friends would not harm the friendship.
I'm going to present two typical cases to prove the validity of my viewpoint.
First of all, money can't cause problems between true friends.
Trust is the foundation of the companionship, and lacking confidence in each other would result in gaps in the two.
Once Vivian, my high school classmate, has granted loans to me, I worked part-time every week to try my utmost to repay it with the understanding that she trusted me for me being her friend that would treasure our fellowship.
True friends always put themselves in others' shoes.
As my friends are all so thoughtful, there's no possibility for me not to treat them in the same way in return.
As long as the two believe in and cherish each other, then the friendship would defeat the temptation of short-term interest.
Moreover, borrowing money from friends not only does no harm to the fellowship but in fact enhances it.
There must be certain reason for one to ask others for financial help.
In this case, if one can loosen one's purse strings generously and hook one's friend up, it would definitely promote the friendship.
My mom's friend, aunt Liu, divorced at her middle-age, having no one to depend on.
Then my mom showed her generosity and lent her money as her daily expenses until she could earn her life again.
Aunt Liu was so grateful that she often mentioned this.
As the old saying goes, "A friend in need is a friend indeed."
My mom accompanied her in her bad time which contributed to the validity of their companionship.
This example suggests that hard condition can build strong friendship.
However, some believe that borrowing money from friends would be an injury to their fellowship for longtime no sign of payment would damage friends' confidence and patience and gaps could be easily generated.
To tell the truth , true friendship won't be harmed because true friends won't let their friends suffer but think of them instead.
In this case, the fellowship would be safe though the behaviour of borrowing  money takes place.
To sum up, money is disable to endorse real friendship.
Caring and helping between friends is a great promotion to the consistent friendliness.
So from my point of view, borrowing money from friends does no damage to the feeling.
Borrowing money from friends is an usual thing in our life.
Sometimes when you hurry to work and forget to take your wallet, you'll borrow money from your friends.
Sometimes when you go shopping and are really attracted by an expensive watch, you'll borrow money from your friends.
Some people think that borrowing money from friends may damage the friendship.
But to me, if you do that occasionally and not a large sum of money that your friends can't afford, it'll be all right.
True friendship will not be hurt by lending and borrowing money.
When we get along with others, without trusting each other, it'll be easy to have problems in the relationship.
Friendship is built on the trust between each other.
When I borrow money from my friends, they are all very generous.
They know me well and also believe in me, so they lend me the money without hesitating.
And I will return the money in time to protect and keep our friendship.
So borrowing money is not a threaten to the friendship.
Borrowing money from friends will not damage the friendship, sometimes it can even strengthen the friendship.
There must be a reason when your friends borrow money from you, if you can do your best and help him or her, that will definitely reinforce the friendship.
Once, a roommate of my university turned me for help.
She had just got a job, and didn't have a good salary.
But one of her close relatives was seriously ill, she needed money.
When she called me and asked me, I answered yes without hesitation.
I lent her two thousand yuan.
Not long after that, she paid all the money back.
Now we live and work separately in this city, but still keep in touch with each other.
And she really appreciates my help.
That thing has much improved our friendship.
Some people think borrowing money can hurt the friendship.
In their opinion, people usually wonder why my friends need to borrow money and if they will pay it back.
In fact, true friendship is not influenced by these.
True friends know each other so well that they trust each other, and of course they don't doubt about it.
So, don't be worried when you really need to borrow money from your friends.
All in all, borrowing money from friends is not a bad thing for the friendship.
It is not a challenge for true friendship, and it can even enhance the friendship.
When we get stuck in some troubles, we are inclined to seek help for families and friends, inevitably, we face a choice-- whither  to borrow money from friends or not?
Someone hold the idea that boorrowing money from friends will be harmful to the friendship, however, others consider that borrowing money from friends will not damage the friendship.
As far as I am concerned, I account that it will be hurt the friendship when borrowing money from friends.
Firstly, it is easy to cause contradiction becase of borrowing money from friends.
Friendship is pure, when involving the dispute of behalf,like money,the friendship will not be pure anymore.
With the contradictions becoming more and more, the friendship, consequently, will be hurted.
last summer, I went for travelling, and my friend zhang's home was near to the place I travelled.
When knowing this, he called me and wanted to invite me to a meal.
We went to the restaurant, at the moment of finishing the meal, he answered a phone, then he told me he had a emergency, after borrowing money from me, he went away in a haste.
A few days passed away, he said nothing with the borrowed money.
I considered that the meal was a plea, the main reason he saw me was that he wanted borrow money from me.
After borrowing, he acted as if the thing had never happened.
It is the behvior that I didn't want to be his friend anymore.
Secondly, borrowing money from friends will make us lose face.
Friendship is on the basis of equality.
When there is relationship of money, one side will feel dishonor in the front of the other side.
With the break of equality relationship, the friendship will finally get damage.
When my friend rent money for me, before I return it, I feel embarrassed when meeting friends.
I am afraid that my friend will press me.
After returning money, because I can't help thinking the condition of borrowing money, I will feel awkward when meeting the friends.
As a result of borrowing money. connection times become fewer and fewer.
As time goes by, the emotion will fade.
Of course, someone will support that borrowing money from friends will not effect the friendship, as friends should help each other.
But actually, when there is a relationship of money between friends, there will be lots of problems, such as the misunderstanding, the reduce of communication, etc.
All these problems will hurt the friendship, so I believe that borrowing money is an injury to fellowship.
To sum up, borrowing money from friends will not only lose face,but also cause dispute.
The matters will have a bad influence on the pure friendship.
So I believe that borrowing money damage fellowship.
Nowadays, many people would borrow money from their friends.
However, some people believes borrow money from their friends is an injurey to fellowship, some are not.
In my opinion, borrow money from our friends won't injure our friendship.
The reasons are as follows.
True frisendship won't hurt because of problems of money.
In the process of interpersonal interaction, it is easy to cause problems if we don't trust each other.
Friendship is on the basin of equality.
For instance, one of my good friends ask me whether I can lend some money to her because she needs to take bus and back to home and there was not enough money to buy a ticket.
At the time, I brought some money and could lent it to her.
She gave the money back to me after that day.
I think our friends would gave money back to us as soon as possible if our friends are trustworthy.
Borrowing money from friends won't injure fellowship, it will increase friendship.
There must some reasons so that people would borrow money from others.
If we helped other when they needed it in emergency it must improve friendship betweeen two people.
For instance, one of my mother's friends would like to buy a house but she was lack a bit of money.
She tried to borrow it from my mother and my mother did.
Till now, she is still thankful to my mom's help and kindness.
This example illustrates that borrow money from friends may help us to improve our fellowship.
Some people believe that borrow money from friends will hurt friendship, the reason is some friends wil not give money back to us.
Actually, true friendeship will not be injured because true friends will not only repay it to us but also the relationship will become better and better.
Thus, borrow money from friends won't injured friendship.
In short, true frienship won't cause problems because of the money, borrow money can actually increase friendship.
Thus, I believe borrow money from friends won't injure fellowship.
In daily life, it is common that people who is facing difficulties have to borrow money from others.
Many people turn to their relatives, their friends or the bank when they need money.
In my opinion, each of these ways has its own merits and demerits, but the worst choice is borrowing money from friends.
Due to the fragility of friendship, borrowing money may damage the relationship between friends.
I will illustrate my point of view by the following reasons.
First of all, if you have no ability to repay the money, your friends may doubt about your moral quality, which is obviously an injury to fellowship.
Especially when you can not explain in time why you have to postpone returning money, your friends may misunderstand you in mind.
I will give you an example of my friend.
He borrowed money from his friend and promised repaying after a month.
However, he didn't have enough money on the deadline of repaying, and he didn't explain the reason to his friend, which made his friend think that he didn't return the money on purpose.
Although my friend returned the money several days after, their friendship was still influenced by this misunderstanding.
If he didn't borrow money from his friend, they would still keep a good relationship now.
Secondly, borrowing money from friends may cause inequality between friends, which make the relationship between friends not pure any more.
Normal friends should be equal to each other, while in a loan relation, the person who borrows money often feel inferior to another.
One of my friends once borrowed a large amount of money from another friend of mine, and after that he often felt ashamed when he met we friends.
In  result, he was less and less willing to take part in our parties, which led that his relations with other friends not close as before.
If he didn't borrow money from friends, he would not feel inferior to others and still keep a close relation with us.
Admittedly, it's much easier to borrow money from friends than from the unfamiliar.
In addition, many friends are ready to offer help.
However, in many cases, people are unable to deal with these problems well after borrowing money, which lead to a misunderstanding between friends and make the friendship less closer.
In conclusion, delaying repaying may cause that friends doubt about your moral quality, and borrowing money may also cause the inequality between friends.
Therefore, borrowing money from friends sometimes have a bad impact on friendship.
Friend is someone who you know well and like, and who is the confidant of whole life.
During the whole life, we would face different difficulties.
Sometimes, we would borrow money from our friends to solve the problem, but this action can't damage the friendship.
The real friendship can't be broken by borrowing money.
Because the fellowship is built on trusting with each other.
Because of the trust, no matter we borrow money from others or others borrow money from us, we will do our best to help our real friends when we can afford it.
The real friendship is above all life's treasures without  interest disputes, it can't be damaged by borrowing money.
Borrowing money from friends not only isn't an injury to friendship, but also develop it.
People borrow money from their friend because they need to use the money to solve the problems urgent.
If you help your friend at that time, it would develop the friendship between you two.
I once thought to buy a figure of animation, but I can't afford the balance payment.
And my friend help me with his money, I remember it until now.
We develop our friendship bases on helping each other again and again, and if we face the great challenge in the future we won't be afraid relying on our friendship.
Someone consider that borrowing money from friends is harmful to the companionship because someone would go back on a person when they are faced with some benifit.
Actually, the real friendship can't be broken,because it is above all the benifits.
The people who you don't want to lend money to   is not your real friend.
So, borrowing money from friends won't damage the friendship.
In summary,the real friendship won't be broken because of the money.
Borrowing money from friends not only isn't an injury to friendship, but also develop it.
So,in my opinion, borrowing money from friends won't damage the friendship.
We used to say that the friendship will be damaged if borrowing money from friends, but nowadays we say that our purses will be hurt if we concern about our friends.
In my opinion, i think borrowing money from friends won't do harm to the friendship.
True friendship won't have gaps because of the money.
In the interpersonal communication, if people don't trust in each other,the slits will easily appear, thus i think friendship is built on trust.
When my friend come to borrow money from me, i will undoubtedly lend him money within my capacity.
Because i do want to give him a hand, and i believe that he will repay the money.
Borrowing money between friends is just a kind of phenomenon like moving the money from here to there, and let it back.
Therefore, borrowing money from friends is harmless to the friendship.
Furthermore, borrowing money will not only do no harm to the friendship but also uplevel the friendship.
We won't borrow money from others until we are in trouble, and we will really feel grateful if someone can help us during this hard time.
This kind of feeling will remain forever.
For example, my mother has a good friend who came to Shanghai to support her mun and two brothers.
Once she was badly ill, but almost all her salary was sent back to home, so she borrowed money from my mother to get treatmment.
Ten years have passed away, but she still sometimes share this old story with her relatives and friends.
Difficulties will come to all of us with no sign and we will take those who help us into our heart.
As we are willing to lend money to our friends, the trust and concerning will be briefly delivered to them.
Nourished by the love and care, the friendship will be more stable.
Some people hold the view that borrowing money from friends will harm the friendship, because that may dishonor themselves.
In fact, the true friendship won't be damaged, because understanding and care is the fundation of the friendship.
To sum up in conclusion, borrowing money from friends won't damage the friendship.
In this complex society, human beings always have to meet different types of people.
Friends are one of the most important people that you have to meet.
Sometimes your friends need your help, or perhaps sometimes you help each other.
Borrowing money is an embarrasing event.
However, I think it will not harm the relationship between you and your friends.
First of all, borrowing money is a normal thing in helping each others.
From my personal perspective, if you can keep your word when you borrow your friends, it is very diffcult to hurt the relationship.
For instance, once I borrow my friend's money, the number is 100 rmb.
At that time, I said that I must pay back in 1 week.
After one week, I initatively find my friend and pay back that 100 rmb.
Although it makes some troubles to my friend, our relationship still stable and I don't harm him.
Therefore, I think that borrowing money from your friend is not a big deal.
In addition, if your friend doesn't want to borrow you money, it is still normal and it will not lose your reputation.
Your friend usuallly have a reason when he or she doesn't incline to borrow you money, such as he or she really doesn't have enough money, or it is necessary to do other things, and so on.
Indeed, although you obey your word, sometimes it is hard to predict things happened.
For example, your premise is 1 week, however, your friend finds out a stuff on the Internet that will be sold out in 2 days.
Then your friend faces a dilemma.
That may create some conflicts.
Whereas, you can use the conversation skills to overcome these predicaments.
In general, borrowing money from your friend is not a harmful thing.
for most chinese people,talking about money is always not a pleasant thing.
somebody claim that,when people's friendship connects with money,the pure relation between two preson will metamorphic.
in my opinion,i am in agreement with the claim that people's friendship will be destroyed by money.
there are some reasons and examples to illustrate my point of view.
borrowing and lending money are the most serious contradictory to influence friendship.
if you are going to lending money to your friends,you will worry about whether he will repay on time.
if you borrowing money from your friends ,you will be embarrassed with you friends.
whatever,the contradictory always exsists.
there is a example of my own experienxe,i lended a sum of money to my roommate during my college time,but my roommate didn't repay me for a very long time .
i thought she intended not give the money back to me .
eventually,i have to charge her.
but she repaied the money in a unpleaseant attitude.
i felt really disappointed about her condition.
the friendship between us gradually fade away.
secondly,borrowing money with friends may make us lose face.
that is becaues we give the impression of weakness when we borrow money,we even have a feeling of self-abasement.
as long as you have not given the money back ,you do not want to meet the friend again.
you are not willing to  keep in touch with the friend,where can we find the friendship?
still taking for example the above mentioned experience of mine.
after my roommate borrowed money from we ,we seldom communicated with each other,
that's the real reason make we two not family again.
admittedly,i am not denying that friendship must break up because of money.
cash nexus is also a way for friends to get a hold of each other.
however,as long as we are extreme cautious when coming down to the money problem with friends,the issues above will be perfectly solved.
to put it in a nutshell,it is easily hurt friendship when have something to do with money.
it is not only because repaying money will lead to a contraditory but also friendship will be disappeared on account of face problem .
whatever,an un sophisticated friendship between friends is always the most valuable thing.
The help provided by friends is regarded as a natural part of the friendship, and borrowing money from friends is not an exception.
Some people think that borrowing money from friends is a reasonable thing without damaging the friendship.
However, I hold the opinion that borrowing money from friends is likely to do harm to the friendship.
For it will generate bitterness between friends when returning money and be embarrassed to us when borrowing money.
Firsty, borrowing money will generate bitterness between friends when returning the money.
Friendship is pure,but once it sinks into the dispute of money, the purity will disappear, with biterness multiplies at the same time.
I travelled to Beijing with my friend Linda after graduating from high school.
I paid for her temporarily because she didn't bring enough money.
However, she never mentioned it since then, which I thought was what she did on purpose.
We felt embarrassed because of the dispute of money, and our friendship was getting weaker and weaker after that travel.
What's more,borrowing money from friends is likely to make us lose face.
The friendship is on the basis of equality.
If two friends are influenced by money,the person who borrows money will feel himself inferior to the person who lends money,thus breaking the equality of the relationship between the friends and damaging the friendship as a result.
Once upon a time, I borrowed money from Jack due to the financial absence,which dishonored us at that time.
As a consequence,I avoided to meet him and we were not as close as we used to be.
Some people are in favor of the idea that borrowing money from friends will not affect the friendship as they take it for granted that friends should help each other.
I admitted that friendship demands offering help selflessly.
However, selflessness doesn't mean offer the help which will become an injury of friendship .
Once there are some factors of money in the friendship,they will deeply hurting the friendship owing to development of barrier and the break of the equality in relationship.
From what I have stated above, borrowing money from friends will not only create bitterness of friendship but also damage the equality of the relationship between two friends,which will keep friends at a distance and do harm to the friendship.
So it's of wisdom for us to prevent our friendship from financial issue.
It is common that we all have time experiencing monetory shortage.
And it is a baffling qestion whether to borrow money from friends for many people.
Thus, an interesting discussion arises: does it really harmful to friendship if people borrowing money from their friends?
As far as I concerned, it will not damage friendship to borrow money from friends.
My view point is based on the following reasons.
First of all, truely friendship will not be harmed by monetary problems.
It is easy to become farther in the interpresonal relationship if people do not trust each other.
Friendship is built on mutual trust.
For example, when I am out for my study in another city, I will always give my house's key to my friends in case of the emergency.
If I am really concerned about my friends are to damage my economic investment, of course I will not do that.
Because real friends really trust each other, and believe they will not refuse to pay the money back, borrowing or lending money will become a common and usual help between friends.
Futhermore, borrowing and lending money between friends will not only not damage friendship, but also improve it.
Borrowing money from others must have a decent reason.
If one generously helps that friend to save him or her from trouble, then the friendship between them must be strenthened.
For instance, my mother's friend's mother once got a serious sick and needed a lot of money to do an operation.
Once he asked my mom to borrow some money, my mother immediately agreed and helped him.
After the operation, his mother's desease was cured and from that time, his mother treated my mother as her daughter and that friend of my mother knew who was his real friend and saw her as his sister.
Thus, there must be reasons for a person to borrow money.
If one helps friend to overcome difficulties, that friend will also be thankful and graceful and consequently promotes friendships.
However, there are also some other voices saying that borrowing money from friends will do harm to friendship because if borrowers postpone to pay the money back again and again, it will make both of the friends unhappy.
But in fact, real friendships will not be influced.
Real friends will also think for you, and will pay you back as soon as possible if they have money because they do not want you to be anxious.
As a result, borrowing money will not damage friendship.
All in all, borrowing and lending money between friends will not harm friendship.
Because real friends will not be separated by money, but become closer.
It is sometimes said that borrowing money from a friend can harm or damage the friendship.
In my regard,it does synchronize with my opinion.
As soon as you ask a friend to lend you money,conflict will be caused by the matter of returning  the money.
Friendship is pure.
Once you are involved in beneficial arguements,the relationship will not be pure anymore and numerous conflicts will come up.
Without thinking twice then,I borrowed 5yuan for beakfast from my roomate,who has finanical problem.
It was not until he mentioned that three months later did I recall it shamely.
Five yuan may count  nothing for me,but for my mate,it could be essential.
However,It was I that didn't care about the problem thus our relationship gapped.
Borrowing money from friends can dishonor ourselves.
Friendship  is on the basis of equality.
The equal relationship  will break up,friendship will be damaged thereafter if beneficial relationship as such is involved in friendship or one side feels dishonored.
Sometimes,it hurts my feeling to borrow money from friends.
My friends might consider me as a stint person.
In that understanding I lost some of my social value.
And it would be rather difficult for me to do such things later.
Someone suggests that borrowing money from friends doesn't harm friendship .
In their mind,material relationship can always be treated rationally.
In fact,once money relationship forged between friends,trouble can come after.
If debt is not paid off,friends would be suspicious about each other.
These problems may undermine friendship,
so I believe borrowing money from friends will hurt  the friendship.
As I conveyed above,borrowing money from friends can cause conflict when it comes to payoff the debt.
Futhermore,it hurts one's feeling to borrow to some extent.
So I think borrowing money from friends does undermine friendship.
As the development of society, the demand of material life of people is increasing, so people need more and more money.
Some people prefer to borrow money from their friends, and they think that friends should help each other.
However, others think that friendship should not invove in money.
As far as i am concerned, one that borrow money from his friends will not be harmful to their friendship.
Real friendship will not be damaged because of money.
In people's social interaction, if two person do not trust the other, their relationship will easliy be damaged.
However, friendship is built on mutual trust.
when i was in middle school, i got several friends whose family is much richer than mine.
Once a time, when i pass through a bookstore, i found a book that interested me very much but i just could not afford it.
In fact, at that time, i really wanted to borrow money from my friends but i was afriad that it will be harmful to our relationship.
However, then, one of my friends noticed that i did not have enough money and he lent money to me, which touched me deeply.
I can never forget the moment he show me the money;
Borrowing money did not influence of relationship because our relationship is built on mutual trust.
Although some friends become distant after they borrow money from the other,
i think that is because that they are not real friends.
Their relationship is not on the basis of mutual trust.
Borrowing money from a real friend will not damage their freindship.
on the contrary, their realtionship will be more tight after that.
For what have been disscussed above, i think borrowing money can strengthen the trust between friends, resulting improving their friendship.
Now is a legal society.

Community service is an important component of education here at our university.
We encourage all students to volunteer for at least one community activity before they graduate.
A new community program called "One On One" helps elementary students who've fallen behind.
You education majors might be especially interested in it because it offers the opportunity to do some teaching—that is, tutoring in math and English.
You'd have to volunteer two hours a week for one semester.
You can choose to help a child with math, English, or both.
Half-hour lessons are fine, so you could do a half hour of each subject two days a week.

Nowadays, the economic world seems like it is in big trouble, the value of the stocks in China keeps decreasing.
As a result, borrowing money has become a ordinary thing.
If things develop as what those people expect who think borrowing money will hurt the friendship between friends, there will no longer be business partners, also, the world will be in chaos.
So I will definitely hold the faith that borrowing money will not break the friendship.
True friendship won't have bad blood because of money.
When we make friends with others, if we do not trust each other,  we will probably have bad blood.
Friendship is the basic of mutual credits.
In our daily lives, consuming has become normal.
We all like to go out with our friends, due to the fact that staying with friends can improve the relationship between two men.
However, in some cases, such as purchasing for your coffee, you will be literally embarrassed if you forgot to bring your wallet.
Nowadays, many people are afraid to borrow money to their friends.
Because they fear that if their friends don't repay them, they would lose both their friends and their money.
However, I believe that borrowing money from our friends will not harm our friendship.
Ture friendship will not be harmed by money issues.
Because when people socialize with other people, if they don't trust each other, then there will easily be gaps between people.
Friendship is built on the basis of mutual trust.
For example, if one of my friends asked me for some money due to some emergency and never paid me back, it means that he thought we don't have friendship, or the friendship is not worth the money I borrowed him.
Then it's not money that harmed the friendship, because there was no friendship.
Borrowing money from our friend will not harm our friendship.
On the contrary, it will enhance our friendship.
Because your friend must have some emergency to ask you for help.
And if you can help him, it will definitely enhance your friendship.
My father once borrowed money from his friends for his business, and most "friends" made an excuse and didn't help him except several ture friends.
Since then, my father believes that only those who will help him when it's an emergency can be called ture friends.
Borrowing money is a kind of help.
And friends exist because we need each other's help.
This example shows that borrowing money from friends could enhance our friendship.
Someone believes that borrowing money from friends could harm their friendship, because if their friends don't pay them back then they would lose both their money and their friends.
In fact, ture friendship will not be harmed, because ture friends will not refuse to pay you back on purpose.
In summary, ture friendship will not be harmed by borrowing money and even can be enhanced by it.
So I believe borrowing money will not harm our friendship.
